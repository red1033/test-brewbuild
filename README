NAME

    brewbuild - This is the front-end script for Test::BrewBuild

NOTICE

    This is a devel version and shouldn't be used. I'm working out the
    myriad of caveats that encompass Windows' 'berrybrew' that doesn't
    exist on Unix-type platforms.

    By v1.05, I'll have the majority of the problems resolved, the code
    cleaned up, and documentation on suitable setups for pristine testing
    platforms written.

    Pass or fail, I need this on CPAN for internal testing.

SYNOPSIS

    You must be in the root directory of the distribution you want to test.
    Also, it is imperative that you have cpanm installed in a global
    location (eg: perlbrew install-cpanm.

    Run all unit tests against all installed instances with no other action

        brewbuild
    
        # output
    
        perl-5.8.9 :: PASS
        perl-5.20.3 :: PASS
        perl-5.22.1 :: PASS

    Run tests on the local working copy of the current module, then run all
    tests of all reverse dependencies of this module (as reported by CPAN),
    to ensure the down river modules will work with your new build

        brewbuild --revdep # or -R

    Print usage information

        brewbuild -h

    Run on specific versions only (Unix)

        brewbuild --on 5.20.3 -o 5.8.9

    Install three new instances of perl, randomly

        brewbuild --new 3

    Enable verbose output. Default is 0, maximum is 7

        brewbuild --debug 5

    Remove all perl instances (less the currently used one), install two
    new random versions, and run tests against all installed perls

        brewbuild --remove --new 2

    Install all available perl versions, and run tests against all of them

        brewbuild --new -1

    Install a specific version and run tests on all instances (include just
    the number portion of the version per "perlbrew available" or
    "berrybrew available"

        brewbuild --version 5.20.3

    ...multiple versions can be passed in at once

        brewbuild -v 5.20.3 -v 5.14.4 -v 5.23.5

DESCRIPTION

    This brewbuild script installed by the Test::Brewbuild module allows
    you to perform your unit tests across all of your Perlbrew (Unix) or
    Berrybrew (Windows) Perl instances, with the ability to very easily
    create your own plugins that contain the code that perlbrew/berrybrew
    exec will process. (See Test::BrewBuild::Plugin::DefaultExec for an
    example).

    For Windows, you'll need to install Berrybrew (see "SEE ALSO" for
    details). For Unix, you'll need Perlbrew.

    It allows you to remove and reinstall on each test run, install random
    versions of perl, or install specific versions.

    All unit tests are run against all installed instances.

    The actual module is just a helper for the installed script, and isn't
    designed for end-user use.
