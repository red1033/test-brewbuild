NAME

    brewbuild - Perl/Berry brew unit testing automation across installed
    perl versions (Windows and Unix).

SYNOPSIS

    You must be in the root directory of the distribution you want to test.
    Note that all arguments passed into the script have single-letter
    counterparts. Also note that each time the command is run, your unit
    tests will be run on all installed *brew instances.

        # run all unit tests against all installed instances with no other action
    
        brewbuild
    
        # use a custom plugin containing the build/test commands to pass to
        # perlbrew (can also be set in $ENV{TBB_PLUGIN} for persistence)
    
        brewbuild --plugin 'Test::BrewBuild::Plugin::DefaultExec' # default
    
        # install three new instances of perl, randomly
    
        brewbuild --count 3
    
        # enable debugging, and run against all installed instances (can be used
        # in conjunction with all other args). Use 0-7 as the argument to it.
        # Set to 5 to get typical output beyond just the results
    
        brewbuild --debug 5
    
        # remove all perl instances (less the currently used one), install two
        # new random versions, and run tests against all installed perls
    
        brewbuild --remove --count 2
    
        # install all available perl versions, and run tests against all of them
    
        brewbuild --count -1
    
        # print usage information
    
        brewbuild --help
    
        # install a specific version and run tests on all instances (include just
        # the number portion of the version per "perlbrew available" or "berrybrew
        # available"
    
        brewbuild --version 5.20.3
    
        # multiple versions can be passed in at once
    
        brewbuild -v 5.20.3 -v 5.14.4 -v 5.23.5

DESCRIPTION

    This brewbuild script installed by the Test::Brewbuild module allows
    you to perform your unit tests across all of your Perlbrew (Unix) or
    Berrybrew (Windows) Perl instances, with the ability to very easily
    create your own plugins that contain the code that perlbrew/berrybrew
    exec will process. (See Test::BrewBuild::Plugin::DefaultExec for an
    example).

    For Windows, you'll need to install Berrybrew (see "SEE ALSO" for
    details). For Unix, you'll need Perlbrew.

    It allows you to remove and reinstall on each test run, install random
    versions of perl, or install specific versions.

    All unit tests are run against all installed instances.

    The actual module is just a helper for the installed script, and isn't
    designed for end-user use.
