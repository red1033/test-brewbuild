=head1 NAME

bbdispatch - Dispatch C<Test::BrewBuild> builds to remote test servers.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Dispatch a default C<brewbuild> test run on the two listed remote servers,
using the repository you're currently working in:

    bbdispatch -t 10.0.0.1:7800 -t 10.0.0.2:9999

Dispatch a custom command to a single remote tester:

    bbdispatch -c "brewbuild -R" -t 10.0.0.1:7800

Have the remote testers test a specified repository:

    bbdispatch -r https://github.com/user/repo-name -t 10.0.0.1:7800

Add debugging to any other command string:

    bbdispatch [...] -d 0-7

Set maximum number of concurrent testers to communicate with (default is 4):

    bbdispatch [...] -f 8

Example output of a basic run where I'm in a git repository directory:

    bbdispatch -t localhost -t 192.168.252.90 -t 192.168.252.96 -t 192.168.252.95

    192.168.252.95 - x86_64-linux

    5.22.1 :: PASS

    192.168.252.90 - MSWin32-x64-multi-thread

    5.18.4 :: PASS
    5.22.1 :: PASS

    localhost - MSWin32-x64-multi-thread

    5.22.1 :: FAIL

    192.168.252.96 - amd64-freebsd

    5.22.1 :: PASS
    5.23.7 :: PASS
    5.8.9 :: FAIL
    5.10.1 :: FAIL
    5.18.4 :: FAIL

All FAIL log files are stored locally when dispatching to identify the issues.
If I'm letting BrewBuild determine the repository, the files will be stored in
C<./bblog>. If a repo is specified, they'll be put into
C<~/brewbuild/repo/bblog>.

    192.168.252.96_5.10.1-FAIL.bblog
    192.168.252.96_5.18.4-FAIL.bblog
    192.168.252.96_5.8.9-FAIL.bblog
    localhost_5.22.1-FAIL.bblog

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This script dispatches C<brewbuild> build sets to pre-configured
L<Test::BrewBuild::Tester> test servers.

By default, we try to look up the repository information from your current
working directory. If it can't be found, you must supply it on the command line
or within the configuration file.

=head1 COMMAND LINE OPTIONS

=head2 -t, --testers

A list of testers to dispatch to. Can be sent in multiple times. Format of the
testers is C<IP:Port>. If C<Port> is ommitted, we'll default to C<7800>.

Testers can also be configured within the config file. Testers set on the CLI
will override those.

=head2 -c, --cmd

By default, the testers will simply run C<brewbuild>. You can send in any
C<brewbuild> commands here within quotes, so long as the first argument is
C<brewbuild>.

This option will override anything in the configuration file.

=head2 -r, --repo

By default, if a repository isn't specified in the config file, we'll attempt
to locate the repository information from the current working directory.

Set this to the repo link to override both.

=head2 -d, --debug

Set to 0-7 to enable debug logging.

=head2 -f, --forks

By default, we maintain four (4) testers concurrently. Pass an integer to this
argument to change the default number of concurrent testers.
