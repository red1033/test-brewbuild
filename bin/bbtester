=head1 NAME

bbtester - Remote Windows/Unix testing platform server daemon for
L<Test::BrewBuild>

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Listen for incoming build requests on all IPs and port 7800 (TCP)

    bbtester start

Listen using a different IP/Port pair

    bbtester start -i 192.168.10.5 -p 7789

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This script is the listener end of the distributed C<Test::BrewBuild> testing
environment.

C<bbtester> daemonizes a L<Test::BrewBuild::Tester> object, and listens for
incoming build requests from a test dispatcher.

We then run the appropriate commands, and return the results to the dispatcher
for processing.
