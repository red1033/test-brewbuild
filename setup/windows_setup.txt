Setting up a pristine Windows test environment from scratch.

Note that the key here is that your %PATH% must be free and clear of anything
Perl. That means that if you're using an existing box with Strawberry or
ActiveState installed, you *must* remove all traces of them in the PATH
environment variable for ``brewbuild'' to work correctly.

Easiest way to guarantee a working environment is using a clean-slate Windows
server with nothing on it. For a Windows test platform, I mainly used an
Amazon AWS t2.small server.

- download/install git for Windows:
    https://git-scm.com/download/win)

- create a repository directory, and enter it:
    mkdir c:\repos
    cd c:\repos

- clone and configure berrybrew
    git clone https://github.com/dnmfarrell/berrybrew
    cd berrybrew
    bin\berrybrew.exe config (type 'y' when asked to install in PATH)

- close the current CMD window and open a new one to update env vars

- check available perls, and install one that'll become your core base install
    berrybrew available
    berrybrew install 5.22.1_64
    berrybrew switch 5.22.1_64
    close CMD window, and open new one

- make sure it took
    perl -v

- install Test::BrewBuild
    cpanm Test::BrewBuild
